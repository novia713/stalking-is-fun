===================

1. composer install

2. please, use your own app keys of Github API. Get one in https://github.com/settings/applications/new and configure it in /index.php

3. the swagger documentation should work out of the box, in any case, the critical file is doc/swagger.json. Ensure swagger can access to it.
To visualize the documentation point to http://mysite.com/doc/dist/

[if you are having this project in internet, perhaps you don't want swagger were public accesible]

4. [if using nginx] create a /logs directory and use /stalking-nginx.conf
